# AIMyMatrix

**AIMyMatrix** is an all-in-one, cross-platform AI launcher for desktop, inspired by [Stability Matrix](https://github.com/LykosAI/StabilityMatrix).  
It provides a beautiful, modern interface to organize and launch AI tools like InvokeAI, Automatic1111, ComfyUI, Forge, and others‚Äîeach added and managed by the user.

## üö© Current Milestone: Platform Icon System

- **User-added tools**: Add, edit, or remove any AI tool you install, directly from the AIMyMatrix interface.
- **Custom icons**: When configuring a tool, pick any local image file. The app converts it to a portable base64 data URL, so your icons always show up‚Äîno more file path issues!
- **Modern UI**: All platform cards use a unified look with logo, app name, description, and quick action buttons.
- **Live card editing**: Instantly update platform information, icon, or launch script.
- **Dark and light modes**: UI adapts to your theme preference.
- **Robust error handling**: Electron‚Äôs security is respected, and icons always display.
